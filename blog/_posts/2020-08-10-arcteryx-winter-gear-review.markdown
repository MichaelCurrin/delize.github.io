If you may recall from an [earlier post](https://andrewdoering.org/blog/?p=280&preview=true) I really love technical outdoor gear. I have a lot of gear from Arc'teryx mainly two jackets. Because of this I purchased a large list of gear from Arc'teryx as well, all of this from REI - mainly because of their warranty services. When something goes wrong, they usually get the job done in getting things replaced or resolved.

The items that will be reviewed is:




 
  * Chilkoot Pants

 
  * Sabre Pants

 
  * Thetis Zip Neck

 
  * Rho LT Zip Neck

 
  * Konseal Zip Hoodie

 
  * Phase SL

 
  * Conveyer Belt



The only other clothing I have from the company is underwear. Which I am sure you don't want to read about. So lets move on to the other stuff.

I have a North Face NFZ snowboard pants, and these have lasted through a lot. Namely trekking through [Saariselk√§, Finland](https://goo.gl/maps/byPYdxpBSx12) in knee deep snow at midnight in -30C temperature. It was a great trip, and not a lot of gear can handle that very well. But the NFZ handled it great with just some leggings. Some alcohol also might have helped, but, it still felt very warm. Anyways, these snow pants that I currently have a lot of history. The problem is, they are not compatible with Arc'teryx jackets. The whole "every company creates their own systems" is super freaking annoying. If something existed to make non-compatible jackets and pants work together that would be great. So in comes the snowpant purchase







## Chilkoot Pants









## Sabre Pants









## Thetis Zip Neck









## Rho LT Zip Neck









## Konseal Zip Hoodie









## Phase SL









## Conveyer Belt



Arc'teryx did not send me any merchandise. Everything was purchased by me.
