                        <p>" Andrew was able to push forward and successfully complete this (Meeting Room Management) project that solves a big
                        internal issue the company has been having for a while. Andrew worked closely with the Finance team and implemented the
                        asset management (system). Andrew created a detailed and thorough plan to implement a laptop management system, one of
                        the biggest IT challenges we have. "</p>

                        <p>" It's been great to see the thought and effort that you put into the facility-related IT projects (even the frustrating
                        and unreasonable ones haha). It does not go unnoticed or unappreciated!üëç "</p>

                        <p>" Literally within minutes of me placing the request Andrew called me to install the software on my system, which he
                        completed with swift professionalism. ... The speed of fulfillment of the requests and the professionalism demonstrated
                        by each team member along the chain were truly exceptional displays of customer service ‚Äì a feat not easily accomplished
                        in an area as challenging as client support. "</p>

                        <p>" Wanted to give some Kudos to Andrew for identifying a simple fix to an issue our group has been having for a couple of
                        years with HFM add-in for excel crashing. Your group probably spent 12 hrs on this issue last year rebuilding profiles,
                        pc‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶, so this will save us all some time. "</p>
