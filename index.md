My Profile
----------

##### Objective

Produce creative solutions by being curious about each component of the problem, which then allows to create a long-term solution. To increase personal knowledge by being exposed to a variety of innovative technologies, new experiences, and diverse locations.

##### Professional Summary

I am a determined person who works hard to complete the most challenging tasks. I adapt quickly when it comes to changing work environments. I enjoy the challenge of self-learning. I plan carefully so whatever I am doing will be successful for the long term. I get excited when working with new technologies and creating new ways to break the mold on traditional systems. Finally, I enjoy thinking "out of the box" to come up with new resolutions on how to resolve these challenges.

While a lage portion of my current position involves Client Endpoint Management and IAM Management in Operations, I have recently taken an interest and invement into serverless infrastructure and logging, alerting and monitoring. I am currently investing my time into learning these subjects.

##### Personal Summary

I grew up in several different states, and grew up with several experiences in life that made me who I am today. I became interested in a variety of activities, specifically snowboarding, hiking, training, music, photography, and cooking.

I grew up taking family trips to Colorado, where we would go skiing. Eventually, I ended up making the transition to snowboarding and have been enjoying since. I routinely make trips to the mountains during the winter time to snowboard and take in the gorgeous scenery and crisp air. I also used to go on several hiking trips when I was younger leading to an ever greater passion for being outdoors. Staying active, training, and exercising is important to me. I go to the gym at least three times a week to stay fit.

Art & Media, are an important part of my life. I played the drums and various percussion instruments as I was growing up. Playing in jam bands that focused on rock and jazz. Now a days, I tend to enjoy music more than playing it, listening to anything from rock & metal, classical, electronic, hip-hop, and seeing concerts when possible.

An interesting fact about me: I love experiencing new cultures, and travelling. Places I would like to visit in the future include: India, Iceland, Austria, Russia, Japan to name a few. Some of the countries I have been to include: Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Germany, Poland, and various others in Europe. Experiencing the food, the people, and the history of each country.

My Abilities
------------

I have found the best way is by self-learning and hands-on experience. When guidance is required, I then tend to rely on fellow employees, managers, and communities to help advance my knowledge and abilities. Right now I am specifically interested in Continuous Integration and Delivery for endpoint automation and testing, creating tools with python that automate system(s), serverless infrastructure configurations, logging and monitoring, and cloud based automation and integration.

" Literally within minutes of me placing the request Andrew called me to install the software on my system, which he completed with swift professionalism. ... The speed of fulfillment of the requests and the professionalism demonstrated by each team member along the chain were truly exceptional displays of customer service ‚Äì a feat not easily accomplished in an area as challenging as client support.
